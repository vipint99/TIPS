pfsense   , if ping to local LAN interface from base machine or a lan machine fails then it could be that Captive portal is riunning on LAN iterface and preventing traffic to pfsense LAN interface.

enable sshdd ( option 14)  and enjoyy login from base machine /

all local lan should have gateway as lan interface of pfsense

RHEL:
After configuring various bridge on base machine and adding all wan and lan interface to it. everything works fine. But when we systemctl restart network 
all bridge interfaces are removed and I need to re add all.
in the VM config  of each vm , respectibve br-wan or br-lan is written and it should not get removed from respective bridge.?????????????????????
