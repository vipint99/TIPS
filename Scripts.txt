sed -i ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/,/g' test.txt

From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1251999/sed-how-can-i-replace-a-newline-n :

    create a label via :a
    append the current and next line to the pattern space via N
    if we are before the last line, branch to the created label $!ba ($! means not to do it on the last line (as there should be one final newline)).
    finally the substitution replaces every newline with a comma on the pattern space (which is the whole file).
