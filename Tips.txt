Cronjob expression <second> <minute> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week> <year> <commands> 
* (all) – it is used to specify that event should happen for every time unit. For example, “*” in the <minute> field – means “for every minute”
? (any)  –  it is utilized in the <day-of-month> and <day-of -week> fields to denote the arbitrary value – neglect the field value. For example, if we want to fire a script at “5th of every month” irrespective of what the day of the week falls on that date, then we specify a “?” in the <day-of-week> field
– (range) – it is used to determine the value range. For example, “10-11” in <hour> field means “10th and 11th hours”
, (values) – it is used to specify multiple values. For example, “MON, WED, FRI” in <day-of-week> field means on the days “Monday, Wednesday, and Friday”
/ (increments) – it is used to specify the incremental values. For example, a “5/15” in the <minute> field, means at “5, 20, 35 and 50 minutes of an hour”
L (last) – it has different meanings when used in various fields. For example, if it’s applied in the <day-of-month> field, then it means last day of the month, i.e. “31st for January” and so on as per the calendar month. It can be used with an offset value, like “L-3“, which denotes the “third to last day of the calendar month”. In the <day-of-week>, it specifies the “last day of a week”. It can also be used with another value in <day-of-week>, like “6L“, which denotes the “last Friday”
W (weekday) – it is used to specify the weekday (Monday to Friday) nearest to a given day of the month. For example, if we specify “10W” in the <day-of-month> field, then it means the “weekday near to 10th of that month”. So if “10th” is a Saturday, then the job will be triggered on “9th”, and if “10th” is a Sunday, then it will trigger on “11th”. If you specify “1W” in the <day-of-month> and if “1st” is Saturday, then the job will be triggered on “3rd” which is Monday, and it will not jump back to the previous month # – it is used to specify the “N-th” occurrence of a weekday of the month, for example, “3rd Friday of the month” can be indicated as “6#3

UNIX TIPS
To add a person to do commands without SUDO  add that group or user in sudo VISUDO file as 
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
%groupname ALL=(ALL)  ALL

glances  command it installed it gives overall performance of the system

awk -v a="$var1" -v b="$var2" 'BEGIN {print a,b}'

To DO THREAD DUMP 
> jcmd <PID> Thread.print > a.txt

TO DO JAVA HEAP DUMP

jmap -dump:format=b,file=<file_name> <pid>

For example, jmap -dump:format=b,file=heap_dump.hprof 4988

TO SEARCH for a text in multiple files
grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'

    -r or -R is recursive,
    -n is line number, and
    -w stands for match the whole word.
    -l (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.

to trace network and ping in one command
mtr -r -w -c 20 -o "LSDR NBAW JMXI" 202.58.125.2

AWK - different field separator
You have multiple ways to set : as separator:

awk -F: '{print $1}'

awk -v FS=: '{print $1}'

awk '{print $1}' FS=:

awk 'BEGIN{FS=":"} {print $1}'

to know all groups and Users in ubuntu 
referable to use getent passwd / getent group 

 to know IP addresss  - hostname -I
who -b  > to know last system reboot time


PARTITION DISK increase , increase root partition
use sudo gparted tool , after backup
use a bootable usb to boot the system in try ubuntu  and then do gparted 
Just extend by resize the partition , move swap if required else delete and create it again.
After partiton is created  say /dev/sda4  mount it on machine
sudo mkdir  /mnt/<mount name>
 sudo mount -t auto -v /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mount_name
chnage owner ship and permission to this folder 

ip route get <IPADDRESS>  to know which interface was used to go out

When you are stuck with SUDO not working use
 pkexec vi <command>
and correcrt the sudoers.d/file

To open bz2 and xz files

   To preserve the original archive, add the -k option:
   bzip2 -dk filename.bz2
   tar -xf code.tar.xz

to preseve date and time while doing copy
cp -ap  <dir1> <Dir2>

rm -rf {kube1,work2}/lib  will be converted to 
rm -rf kube1/lib work2/lib 

SSH TIPS:
$ ssh admin@172.17.0.2 -p 8101
Unable to negotiate with 172.17.0.2 port 8101: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-dss
 SOLVE it by
    $ ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss admin@localhost -p 8101
TO permanenty add a client to ssh server without a password.
there is a file on ssh server side  /etc/ssh/sshd_config  .
It has a entry for 

AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys

We need to append our client side generated public key into this authorized_keys file.
ssh-keygen  will produce pvt and public keys on client side.

To make a session time out higher either client ssh should keep polling in a innterval or server sshd shhould keep polling all ssh clients.

On client side make  local SSH config file in ~/.ssh/config 

ServerAliveInterval 120

On server side  /etc/ssh/sshd_config   add following .



If stil password less shh fails  and following error occured 

>>>>>>>>>>>sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation
 do following to add on client machine  
 $ ssh-add
confirm with $ssh-add -l


sudo systemctl start docker

******************** configure static IP address on Centos/RHEL ***************
http://ask.xmodulo.com/configure-static-ip-address-centos7.html

check if Network manager is running in that case ifconfig scripts in  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts are not effective .

$ systemctl status NetworkManager.service 
To check which network interface is managed by Network Manager, run:
 $ nmcli dev status 
	[vipin@localhost network-scripts]$ nmcli dev status 
	DEVICE  TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION         
	enp0s8  ethernet  connected     Wired connection 1 
	enp0s3  ethernet  disconnected  --                 
	lo      loopback  unmanaged     -- 

Go to the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts directory, and locate its configuration file (ifcfg-enp0s3). Create it if not found.

How to configure static ip and hpst to guest network in Virtualbox 
https://www.tecmint.com/network-between-guest-vm-and-host-virtualbox/

If inyternet does not work on Guest machin echeck route -n, default route should not be with interface of host-only network(enps03), it should be with NAT ( enps08).
Remove any such if there. To make it permanenet , check /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
change DEFROUTE=no . ( it was yes)
