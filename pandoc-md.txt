Page breaks
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22601053/pagebreak-in-markdown-while-creating-pdf
Since the original specification Markdown was designed for HTML output (which doesn't have the concept of pages) there is no support for page breaks.

Doxygen uses LaTeX to generate its PDFs. It doesn't seem to support inline LaTeX¹, but you should be able to modify the intermediate .tex file and then use pdflatex to generate your PDF:

    Use Doxygen to generate a .tex file
    Edit the .tex file manually add \newpage wherever you want page breaks
    Run pdflatex documentation.tex
    Examine documentation.pdf

This question may be a useful reference for step 3 above.

¹Doxygen does support inline LaTeX formulas, but I wasn't able to find any mention of arbitrary inline LaTeX commands like \newpage that operate in the text environment.
